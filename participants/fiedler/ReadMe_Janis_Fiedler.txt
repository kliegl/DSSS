The aim of this paper is to evaluate the association of self-selected collaborative goal achievement with PA and FVI changes from pre-post in families.
Additionally, the contribution of different family members to collaborative goal achievement will be shown descriptively.

df_fam includes data of the 3 week mobile health intervention period during the SMARTFAMILY trial. Families set self selected goals and received timely feedback on the SMARTFAMILY app.
Pre and Post Data - which consists of a one week measurement each - is still missing from the excel file but I will provide it until the workshop.

df_ind includes the same data only not for the whole family but for each family member. Here, I will add sex and age of the participants to the data.

The Data has not been screened yet for unrealistic values (e.g. if participants tyxped 50 instead of 5 portions into the application) but the raw data is available and will be screened for mistakes until the workshop.
