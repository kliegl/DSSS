(a) Context
Simulation of simple reaction times from a picture-naming experiment. Fifty subjects name  75 different pictures (items) under four transparency conditions (i.e., 300 trials per subject; total N = 15,000). The greyness of the screen background is randomly sampled from a normal distribution for each trial. 

(b) Issues
    (1) Theory-guided contrast specification for four-level factor
    (2) Specificatipn of crossed-random factor linear mixed models
    (3) Visualization of partial effects of covarite x factor interactions

(c) Variables in file
    Subj : subject id; random factor
    Item : item id; random factor
    Trnsp: transparency of item (levels: A = 100%, B = 75%, C = 50 %, D = 25%); 
           within-subject and within-item fixed factor
    scrb : screen background; within-subject and within-item covariate
    rt   : reaction time, dependent variab
